<Aside type="caution">
    A few users have been using Biblioteca for a while now without any major issue. However, as with
    any tool, there might be bugs or issues. If you find any, please report them and always make backups of your data
    and files.
</Aside>
<Steps>

1. Create a `values.yml` file file to hold the configuration of the application

    <Code code={importedCode} lang="yml" title="values.yml" mark={highlights} />

    Check the [Helm Chart](https://github.com/biblioverse/helm/blob/main/charts/biblioteca/README.md) for more information on the configuration options.

    We recommend you set at least the `appSecret` values and decide if you want to persist any data.

2. Run the following command to install the Helm Chart

    ```bash
    helm repo add biblioverse https://biblioverse.github.io/helm/
    helm install biblioteca biblioverse/biblioteca -f values.yml
    ```
3. Once installed the Helm chart will output the instructions to finalize the app's installation and the creation of your first admin user.

4. Access the application at the URL given to you by the `helm install` command.

5. You can login with the name and password you set in step 3.
