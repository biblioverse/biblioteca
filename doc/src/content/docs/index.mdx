    <Card title="What is Biblioteca?">
        Biblioteca is a web application created to manage your personal library. This is an alternative to Calibre and other similar
        software.
        #### Why another library system?
        I created Biblioteca because I wanted to have a simple and easy-to-use library manager. I was not satisfied with the existing
        solutions, so I decided to make my own.
