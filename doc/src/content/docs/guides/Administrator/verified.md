title: Verified books
---

The verification status is a flag on the books. When you add a book, it will be set to false.

If you are an administrator, there is a link in the application menu listing all boks that have not been verified yet.

This feature allows you to know which books have been added recently and for whom you need to verify and update the metadata.

When the flag is checked, the edition controls are removed until you uncheck it.
