<Aside type="caution">
    A few users have been using Biblioteca for a while now without any major issue. However, as with
    any tool, there might be bugs or issues. If you find any, please report them and always make backups of your data
    and files.
</Aside>

On every book page, on the bottom of the page, there is a button to delete the book.
This will remove the book from the database **and the filesystem**.
