<Aside type="caution">
    A few users have been using Biblioteca for a while now without any major issue. However, as with
    any tool, there might be bugs or issues. If you find any, please report them and always make backups of your data
    and files.
</Aside>

Books can be of multiple formats, but for now every book only has one format. Supported formats are 
- epub
- pdf
- mobi
- cbr
- cbz


## Add books from command
Any book in the `public/books` folder will be added to the database when you run the `books:scan` command. If a book 
already exists, its location in the filesystem will be updated, but metadata will not be overwritten.

You can periodically run this command to automatically add new books.

## Adding books from the interface
Adding books to the `public/books/consume` will list them in the `/books/new/consume/files` page.
This is useful when you want to add books to the library but don't want to add them to the database yet or to mount a 
folder where books might arrive later (Maybe like a download folder ðŸ«¢).


## Verified status
When books are added to the database, their "verified" status is set to false and a link to all unverified books is 
available in the menu.
