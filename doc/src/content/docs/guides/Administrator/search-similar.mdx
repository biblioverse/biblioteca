You can provide typesense with an embedding model that will allow it to suggest similar books based on your tags and on the book description.

To do so, add the following line to your .env:
```
TYPESENSE_EMBED_MODEL='ts/e5-small'
```

This will use typesense's integrated models to generate the embeddings and the vector search.

You can use your own ollama or online provider as well for embedding generation:

```
TYPESENSE_EMBED_MODEL='openai/nomic-embed-text'
TYPESENSE_EMBED_URL='http://127.0.0.1:11434'
TYPESENSE_EMBED_KEY='your key'
TYPESENSE_EMBED_NUM_DIM=768
```

To disable this feature, for example in low memory environment, just provide an empty model:

```
TYPESENSE_EMBED_MODEL=''
```
