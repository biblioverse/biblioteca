## Overview

**Vite** is a modern frontend build tool that provides significantly faster development experience compared to traditional bundlers. When developing the Biblioteca frontend, Vite enables:

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Instantly reload code changes in your browser without losing application state
- **Fast Startup**: Near-instant server start and rebuild times
- **Optimized Builds**: Production builds are minified and optimized automatically

During development, assets are served directly from the Vite dev server instead of being statically served from a build directory, enabling these real-time updates.

## Docker Compose Setup

To set up the Vite development server with Docker Compose:

### 1. Include the Vite Compose File

Add the Vite compose configuration to your `docker-compose.override.yaml`:

```yaml
include:
    - docker-compose.vite.yml
```

### 2. Create the Vite Container

After updating your compose configuration, start the Vite service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Access the Development Server

The Vite server is automatically configured with:
- **URL**: `https://biblioteca-vite.docker.test`
- **Proxy**: Routes through Traefik (already configured in the compose file)
- **HMR**: Hot Module Replacement enabled for development

Your frontend code changes will now automatically reload in the browser.

## Troubleshooting

**HMR not working?**
- Verify the Vite container is running: `docker compose logs vite`
- Check that `https://biblioteca-vite.docker.test` is accessible
- Clear your browser cache and hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Port conflicts?**
- Ensure port 5173 (Vite default) is not in use on your host machine

**Changes not reflecting?**
- Verify file watcher is active in the Vite container logs
- Check file permissions in the mounted volume
- Restart the container: `docker compose restart vite`
