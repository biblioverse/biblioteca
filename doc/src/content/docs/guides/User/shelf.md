Shelves are groups of books, they can be static or dynamic.

You can manually add books to static shelves and that's it.

You can also create dynamic shelves, which are based on a query. For example, you can create a shelf that contains all
books from your favorite authors that you haven't read and if you or an administrator adds books from these authors,
they will automatically be listed in there.

## Create a dynamic Shelf
To do this, head to the "All books" page, and update the filters in the top `Filters` sections. When you are satisfied 
with the result, click `Save current filter`, input the name of your shelf and you're good to go!

## Create a static shelf
In your side menu click on "Edit Shelves". Here you can edit or delete all your existing shelves. At the bottom of the page,
you can create a new Shelf.
Once you have created a shelf, head on to the books you want to add in that shelves and below the cover, the list of the 
shelves will be displayed. Add them by clicking on the shelf's name and remove them by clicking again.
