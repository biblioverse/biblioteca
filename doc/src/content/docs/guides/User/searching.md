title: Searching for books
---

There are several ways to search for books in the library.

## Quick search
On top of the navigation menu, you can find a search bar. You can search for books by title, author, series, or tags. 
The search is case-insensitive and will return all books that match the search query.

This is mostly useful when you know what you are looking for and want to find it quickly.


## Filtering
In the "All books" view, you can filter books by many different parameters and find some books. This is useful to create 
dynamic shelves or have a shareable link to a list of books.
