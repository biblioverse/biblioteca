On your homepage, you will see the list of books that you have started reading and their progress. 

You can also see the books that you have marked as "In my reading List" and below, some suggestions based on tags.

All the books series that you have started reading will also appear on your homepage, so you can see where you are in your
progress. Completionists beware!

When you read books in the app or on your kobo, the progress will be updated in the app.
