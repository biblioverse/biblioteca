## Features

### Dynamic shelves
You can create your own shelves and manually add books in them, or you can create smart shelves that will automatically include books based on the rules you define.

### Search
Fast and powerful search with Typesense!

### AI Tagging
Because it's 2024 some AI was bound to be in there somewhere: you can ask chatGPT to tag or write a summary of your books.

### Folder structure
You can define your own folder structure or just mount a folder with your books, scan them in the app and don't relocate them.

### Multi user
You can create multiple users and restrict them to age categories, or just let them have access to everything. (WIP)

### Themes
Light and dark themes are available, and you can easily create new themes.

## Sync with Kobo
Sync your library with your Kobo reader (Work in progress, will be available soon)
